          <h2>The Socio-Economic Impact of Food Deserts</h2>

            <h3>Community & Commerce</h3>
            <p>People often do not know the nutritional benefits of simple fruits and vegetables and how they work in their bodies.  Those who grow up in food deserts view the food culture in their neighborhood as normal.  Residents do not realize how important nutritious food is not only to health, but to the community, the children, and the local economy.</p>

            <p>The main challenge in a food desert is inaccessibility. In these communities, there are not enough businesses to sustain a healthy local economy.  More grocers, restaurants, and urban farming will revitalize these communities. Residents who do not have the means to travel will now have healing foods at their fingertips.</p>

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
            Children who develop unhealthy habits at a young age are more likely to sustain these habits into adulthood. It would be amazing if families could walk to a local garden only a block or two away and pick their groceries!  What if urban farming was made a part of the health and fitness curriculum in schools?  What if students had to grow and maintain a school garden which produced food they could take home to their families?  Let’s create a youth-­centered, farm-based learning opportunities that will expand their food literacy, develop their leadership skills, and foster positive engagement with each other and their community. Plant the seed for the necessary skills of future Black entrepreneurs.

            <h3>Poverty & Crime</h3>
            <p>
            There is a correlation between poverty and violent crime. A distinct feature of poverty is lack of adequate access to food. Take active steps toward eradicating food insecurity and poverty. No family should have to go without food or have access to low-quality food. Prioritize ways to provide aid, services, outreach in communities to mitigate the triggers that often contribute to crime.

            <h3>Health & Nutrition</h3>
            <p>Being unhealthy is bad for your budget!  Why continue to line the pockets of big pharma with copays and out of pocket costs when you can invest your money into maintaining and shopping at an urban garden!  Studies have shown that fast food is linked to mental health problems for people under 30.  Free your body and mind and naturally put nutrients back in your body and support your local garden!</p>
